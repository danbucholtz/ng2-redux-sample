## ng2 Redux Sample ##

Lots of documentation will be coming with this.

## Dependencies ##

Ensure Gulp is installed globally

## Run Examples ##
To get started, run the following:
```
npm install
gulp watch
```

A live-reload server should launch with the examples served up.

## Basic Example ##

The first example is a basic todo list example used in a workshop.  It works pretty much as you'd expect.

## Advanced Example ##

This advanced example shows a complicated, real-world application using Redux to manage your interactions as well as others interactions (events that are pushed to the client from the server).  To avoid having a backend, a timer is "push" data from a fake web socket.
